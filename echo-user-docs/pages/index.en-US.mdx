# Welcome to Dembrane

At Dembrane we believe communities of any size can benefit from being open and collaborative, but this is notoriously difficult to master! That's why were building tools to make this as easy as possible, starting with Dembrane ECHO.

ECHO allows you to capture, analyse, and understand conversations at scale, ensuring every voice is heard, and **no good ideas are lost**.
