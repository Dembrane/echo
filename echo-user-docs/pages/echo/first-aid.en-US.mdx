# First Aid for ECHO

You've created a project and you've been working on your first recordings. Great!
Unfortunately, errors can sometimes occur. Here you'll find an overview of what to do if something goes wrong and tips to further help you.

## Step-by-step plan for issues
#### 1. Report the issue
You do this by navigating to 'Report an issue' in the dashboard. You can find this option under the gear icon in the top right corner. This is the best way to report your problem to us.

## Help Questions

### Help, my transcription contains strange repetitions
If you encounter strange repetitions in your transcription such as "TV GELDERLAND", this means that the audio quality was not sufficient to form a sentence.
This also occurs if the recording continues during breaks when there was no conversation to record. <br/>  
ü´∞**Tip**: Pause your recording when there is a break in your session.

### Help, how do I check my audio quality?
The audio recording is stored in the dashboard for up to 30 days after it has been added. Within this time, you can turn on the audio player at the top of the transcript. This allows you to listen to the audio of the text fragments again.

Navigate to parts in the transcript where strange repetitions occur. Or parts that are very short, for example just 1 sentence.
- Listen to these parts.
- If you can understand what is being said but this is not reflected in your transcription, look at the next help question.
- Can't you understand what was said either? Then unfortunately the audio quality is too low to obtain a good transcription.

### Help, my transcription quality is poor but my audio is okay
Sorry that this has occurred. We do our best to avoid this and to make the transcription process work correctly right away. But fortunately, if the audio is good, we can re-transcribe it.
- Click on the icon of the rotating arrows to start the re-transcription.

### Help, I don't see a conversation appearing in the dashboard
1. Have you checked if the portal is recording properly? No black screen and good wifi connection?
2. If this is the case, there might be some server congestion. <br/> 
üß™ You can test this by scanning the QR code again and starting a new conversation. <br/> 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this one appear in the dashboard? <br/> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then continue with this conversation and close the other one. <br/> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't this one appear either? <br/> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the server is busy. In this case, you need to wait a while. <br/> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything is still working fine behind the scenes. <br/> 

### Help, I don't have internet
You are in a location without internet and still want to use Dembrane later? You can record the conversation with your phone and upload it later. This way you can still use all the analysis capabilities of ECHO, just not in real-time.  <br/> 

You can upload the conversation via the dashboard by clicking on the + icon next to 'Conversations'. This opens your file explorer where you can select a file. If you see a notification in the bottom right corner of your screen that the upload was successful, but you don't see it appear yet, refresh your browser and the recording will appear under conversations.

ü™≤ If this is not the case, make an error report as described above.
