# Collecting Your First Data


## Step 1: Access to the Portal

In general, there are two ways to share access to the portal:

### Option 1: Scan QR Code
For each of your projects, a QR code is automatically created and displayed at the top of your project page. The bar also shows the number of ongoing conversations and gives you the ability to open or close the portal for participation.

To scan the QR code, simply open your phone's camera and point it at the code. A URL to a website should automatically appear. This link will take you to the participant portal.

### Option 2: Direct Links
Alternatively, you can copy and share the link to the portal directly via app or email.

## Step 2: Testing the Portal

1. Before sharing the portal with participants, it's best to try it yourself by scanning the QR code with your phone.
2. Go through the required tutorial step by step.
3. Start recording a short three-minute conversation. The transcripts come in live on the dashboard at 30-second intervals. To see these, you need to look at the left sidebar of your dashboard. Here, under "Conversations," a new conversation will have appeared. This conversation appears after the first 30 seconds of the recording have elapsed.
4. Click on the conversation in the left sidebar of the dashboard.
5. Check if you can see your transcription in the **"Transcription"** tab. If this is the case, you're ready to share your project with participants! Don't forget to stop your recording and click "Complete".
6. Delete your test recording. You can do this by clicking on the recording in the left sidebar. Make sure you are on the overview page. This is located next to the transcript. At the bottom of this page is the button to delete the conversation.

## Step 3: Sharing the Portal with Participants

Once your test is complete, you can start sharing your project with participants. As described above, simply share the QR code or invitation URL through your desired channels such as Email, WhatsApp, etc. For events, you can project the QR during your event or print it out on handouts.

## Step 4: Ready Check Go

To ensure everything goes well during your use of Dembrane ECHO, make sure you explain the following points to your participants:
1. Check that you are connected to a good wifi network.
2. When starting the conversation, your phone will ask for permission to use the microphone. Give permission.
3. Keep your screen on during recording. <br/>
⚠️ A black screen = no recording. <br/>
**TIP** A well-charged phone is less likely to go into sleep mode.
4. Turn on do not disturb. This is good for the privacy of the participant using their phone and causes fewer distractions.
