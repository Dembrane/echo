The core concepts of ECHO are:
* **Portal** - The portal is where participants can join the conversation. The QR code that is scanned leads a participant to the portal.
* **Dashboard** - This is the place where conversations come in and you can perform the analysis.
* **Ask question** - The Ask question interface is where you can chat with a selection of conversations.
* **Library** - The library is the place where you can create insights from ALL your conversations.      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Views** - Views are perspectives with which you can analyze all conversations in a project.     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - **Insights** - Insights are clusters of quotes that ECHO has created from all conversations in a project.
* **Report** - This is the report that is generated from all the conversations in the project.
