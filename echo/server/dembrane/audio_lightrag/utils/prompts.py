# Task 1: TRANSCRIPTION
# - Produce a verbatim transcription of the audio
# - Do not modify, interpret, or rename the speaker IDs
# - Maintain 100% accuracy in word capture
# - Include all audible speech elements
# - The trascription should be a comma seperated list of the verbatim speech, 
#   where every item is a different speaker's speech (speaker turn sperated list)

# Task 2: CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS
# - Analyze the conversation
# - Analyze in relation to:
#   • Previous conversation history
#   • Event context
#   • Speaker dynamics
# - Focus on:
#   • Tone and sentiment analysis per masked speaker
#   • Named entity identification and explanation
#   • Acoustic details (background sounds, voice qualities)
#   • Conversational dynamics between masked speakers
# - Always provide the analysis in English (translate if source is non-English)

# Output Format:
# {{
#     "TRANSCRIPTS": ["<verbatim speech>","<verbatim speech>", ...],
#     "CONTEXTUAL_TRANSCRIPT": "<detailed analysis>"
