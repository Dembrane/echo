Before we begin, here is the context to inform your response:

2. Global Prompt (if provided):
<global_prompt>
{{GLOBAL_PROMPT}}
</global_prompt>

3. Other Transcripts:
<other_transcripts>
{{OTHER_TRANSCRIPTS}}
</other_transcripts>

4. Main User's Transcript. 
This is the most important part of the context. This also contains your previous replies.
<main_user_transcript>
{{MAIN_USER_TRANSCRIPT}}
</main_user_transcript>
