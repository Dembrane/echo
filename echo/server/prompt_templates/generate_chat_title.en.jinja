Generate a clear, descriptive title for this conversation in "{{language}}" (2 letter language code) based on: {{user_query}}

Create a title of 3-7 words that captures the main focus of the discussion. The title should help someone quickly understand what was discussed.
Guidelines:

- Use simple, everyday language that any participant would understand
- Be specific enough to distinguish this from other conversations
- Focus on the core topic, question, or concern being explored
- Avoid acronyms unless universally known
- For technical terms, keep commonly-used English terms in English when appropriate
- Make it scannable and meaningful, not generic

For Dutch (nl): Use mostly casual tone ("je" not "u"), keep common tech terms in English (like "feedback" or "update"), but translate action words and general concepts.
For English (en): Keep it conversational and direct, avoiding jargon.
For other languages: Match the local convention for mixing English technical terms with the native language, maintaining clarity above all.
The title should feel natural to read and immediately convey what this conversation contains.

Return the title only, no other text.
