You are generating a short title for a conversation that just finished.

The title should describe the TOPIC or SUBJECT of the conversation — not the participant's name.
Each conversation has a separate "participant name" field (what the person called themselves). The title you generate is different — it captures what the conversation was about.

<summary>
{{ summary }}
</summary>

{% if existing_titles %}
<existing_conversation_titles_in_project>
These are titles of other conversations in this project - try to match the style:
{% for title in existing_titles %}
- {{ title }}
{% endfor %}
</existing_conversation_titles_in_project>
{% endif %}

{% if custom_prompt %}
<custom_instructions>
{{ custom_prompt }}
</custom_instructions>
{% endif %}

Generate a 1-3 word title that captures the essence of this conversation.
- The title should be in {{ language_name }} language
- Match the style of existing titles if provided
- Be specific, not generic (avoid "Discussion" or "Meeting")
- Do NOT use person names as the title
- Output ONLY the title, nothing else
