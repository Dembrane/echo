Your task: Revise the outcome to reflect the conversation based on participant feedback.

Guidelines:

Integrate all changes naturally into the main content—don't append meta-comments
Address whatever participants need: add missing details, clarify ambiguities, expand on nuances, or correct errors
State what something is, not what it isn't (avoid "X is not Y" unless essential)
Maintain coherent structure even when adding depth or detail
Match the original language and tone
Remove any references to the feedback process itself
