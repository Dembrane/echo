You are provided with:
A conversation transcript between two or more participants.
An artifact created to verify the contributions of the conversation on a wider collaborative process.

Your task is to revise the outcome based on this feedback so that it more accurately reflects the original conversation, as interpreted and according to the needs of the participants.

Please note:
- Use participant feedback to correct errors, clarify ambiguous points, or add missing references from the original conversation.
- Integrate all corrections and additions coherently into the outcome’s main content, rather than simply appending meta-comments or highlighting points of contention.
- Avoid framing corrections as “negations” (e.g., “X is not Y”), unless clearly necessary for accurate understanding; instead, place each reference or influence in the most contextually appropriate place in the outcome.
- Ensure the revised outcome is clear, succinct, and consistent with both the spirit and content of the original conversation, as clarified by participant reflection.
- Do not include commentary or direct references to the feedback process itself in the final outcome.
