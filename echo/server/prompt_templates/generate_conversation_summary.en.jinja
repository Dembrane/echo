Create a summary that captures the essence and meaning of what happened, optimized for glanceability.

## Core Principles

1. **Essence over exhaustiveness**: Capture the "so what?" - the meaningful outcome, decision, or insight - not a blow-by-blow account

2. **Radical conciseness**: Most conversations should summarize to 2-4 sentences. Complex discussions might warrant 1-2 short paragraphs. The summary should always be dramatically shorter than the original.

3. **Meaningful compression**: Ask "what would someone need to know if they missed this?" not "what was discussed?"

4. **Natural language**: Write in flowing prose, not bullet points or structured sections. Avoid headers, lists, and formatting unless the content is genuinely complex and multi-faceted.

5. **Context integration**: 
   - Weave in project context naturally when it adds meaning
   - Note verified artifacts as concrete outcomes without process detail
   - Don't force irrelevant context

6. **Fast reading score**: Before writing, internally assess how glanceable this summary will be on a scale of 1-10:
   - 10 = Instant comprehension (simple, single clear point)
   - 7-9 = Very quick scan (2-3 clear takeaways)
   - 4-6 = Needs focused reading (multiple points or moderate complexity)
   - 1-3 = Requires careful reading (dense, complex, or nuanced)
   
   Aim for 7+ whenever possible. If your draft scores below 7, simplify further.

## What to Capture

Focus on what matters most. Include these elements when they're central to the conversation:

- Decisions made and their rationale
- Problems identified and solutions agreed upon  
- Key insights or realizations
- Concrete next steps or outcomes
- Core dynamics when they shaped the outcome: arguments or reasoning that influenced decisions, tensions between competing priorities, conflicts that needed resolution, or agreements reached on contentious points
- Meaningful disagreements or trade-offs discussed

## What to Skip

- Detailed play-by-play of the discussion
- Implementation specifics unless they're the main point
- Process mechanics (who said what, how decisions were reached)
- Obvious context or background
- Minor disagreements that didn't impact outcomes

## Style Guidelines

- Use commas, parentheses, or "but" instead of em dashes
- Write in direct, conversational prose
- Prefer shorter sentences over complex punctuation
- Use "but" or "however" to show contrast
- Use parentheses for asides or clarifications
- Never use bold, italics, or other text formatting

## Format

- 2-4 sentences for simple conversations
- 1-2 concise paragraphs for moderate complexity
- Natural prose without bullets, headers, lists, or formatting
- Only use structure if genuinely necessary for a multi-faceted discussion

Write as if explaining to a colleague what happened in 30 seconds.
