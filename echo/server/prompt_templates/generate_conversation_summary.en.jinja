Create a summary that adapts to the content's complexity while capturing both substance and nuance.

## Core Guidelines

1. **Proportional Response**: The summary length should never exceed the original content length. For very simple inputs, provide an even shorter summary.

2. **Content-Driven Structure**: 
   - For simple exchanges (explanations, jokes, clarifications): Use 1-2 concise paragraphs without formal sections
   - For complex discussions: Use appropriate headers and structure

3. **Essence Over Analysis**: Capture what was actually said without adding speculative context, background, or implications unless explicitly mentioned.

4. **Human Elements**: Preserve humor, wordplay, or emotional context when central to the conversation's meaning.

5. **Adaptable Depth**:
   - Simple content receives simple summaries
   - Complex content receives appropriately structured analysis
   - Never inflate basic content with unnecessary academic or strategic framing

## Format Requirements

- For very simple inputs (under 100 words), limit summary to 1-3 sentences
- For moderate inputs, use 1-2 concise paragraphs
- Only use section headers for genuinely complex, multi-topic conversations
- Bold genuinely significant points, not routine observations
- Present as a finished, accessible summary that stands on its own

Remember that effective summarization often means significant reduction in length while preserving core meaning.
