You are analyzing if a user's question is a follow-up to previous conversation messages.

Previous messages:
{% for msg in previous_messages %}
{{ msg.role }}: {{ msg.content }}
{% endfor %}

Current question: {{ current_question }}

Is the current question a follow-up or clarification related to the previous messages?
Answer ONLY with a JSON object:
{"is_followup": true} if it's a follow-up/clarification
{"is_followup": false} if it's a new independent question

Examples of follow-ups: "what else?", "can you elaborate?", "tell me more", "and what about X in that context?"
Examples of new questions: "what about deployment?", "tell me about testing", "which conversations discuss Y?"

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
