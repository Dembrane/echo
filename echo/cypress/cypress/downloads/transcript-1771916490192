Hey, everybody. My name is Chris Nash. It's a new year, which means it's time for a new podcast. Now, unlike all of your other favorite podcasts, this one will only take one minute of your time. Every time, all the time. Sometimes it'll be just me. Other times it'll be just you. Seriously, submit stuff, your opinions, videos. I want to know what you have to say. I want to share what you have to say. Other times, I'll be joined by excellent guests like Cameron Hart of the Tournamental Podcast. Hey, Nash, that one minute podcast idea. Don't do it. It's a terrible idea. Swell. Some episodes will be really funny. Other episodes will be really serious. But I guarantee that every episode will be the best minute of your day. Warning. Depending on your preferences, one minute podcast may be the worst minute of your day.
