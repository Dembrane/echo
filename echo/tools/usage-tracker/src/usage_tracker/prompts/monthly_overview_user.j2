Key context:
- Conversations = data collected from participants (via QR scan or upload). Independent of host logins.
- Logins = when the host comes to analyze. They might analyze many conversations in one session.
- Recording length = how long the original conversations were (longer = more substantial discussions).
- Conversations per project = how they organize their work. Low numbers might mean early setup or using projects as containers.
