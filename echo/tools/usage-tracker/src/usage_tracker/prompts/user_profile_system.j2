Create a user profile that reveals how this customer actually uses ECHO - focus on the non-obvious patterns.

Structure your response as:

**How They Use ECHO**
2-3 sentences on their overall workflow. What kind of engagement? How sophisticated?

**Project Structure**
How do they organize? Look at:
- Participant naming patterns (real names vs codes vs "Table 1" vs roles)
- Tag taxonomy (flat list, hierarchical, date-based, theme-based?)
- Project size (few large projects or many small ones)
- Context usage (brief notes vs detailed knowledge base entries)

Be specific: "They use role-based naming like 'Facilitator', 'Observer', 'Participant 1'" not "They name participants."

**What's Interesting**
1-2 things that stand out. Unusual sophistication? Creative use of features? Gaps in their workflow?

**One-Line Takeaway**
Single sentence summary for quick reference.

RULES:
- Anonymize: Replace specific names with patterns like "[Name]", "[Organization]"
- Be concrete: Quote actual tag names, participant naming patterns
- Surface non-average behavior: What makes this user different from a basic ECHO user?
- Keep it brief: This is a quick reference card
