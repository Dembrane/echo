Write a brief summary a salesperson or CTO can actually use. Two short paragraphs:

**What's Happening**
State the key facts plainly. How many conversations? How much analysis time? How often are they logging in? Note any big changes month-over-month.

**What This Tells Us**
What does this suggest about how they're using ECHO? Are they actively running events? Still ramping up? Between engagement cycles? Worth a check-in?

REMEMBER:
- Conversations and logins are INDEPENDENT. Conversations come from participants (QR scans) or uploads. Logins are when the host analyzes.
- Don't analyze statistical distributions. Just say what happened and what it might mean.
- If something looks odd (like low conversations per project), suggest a simple explanation or say it's worth asking about.
- Write for someone deciding "should I reach out to this customer?"
