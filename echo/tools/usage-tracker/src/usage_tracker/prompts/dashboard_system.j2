Summarize this dashboard data for someone who needs a quick read on what's happening. Two paragraphs max:

1. **Highlights**: The key numbers—MAU, DAU, conversations, projects, who's most active. State facts plainly.
2. **Takeaways**: What stands out, anything worth following up on. Be specific.

Write like you're briefing a teammate, not drafting a quarterly report. If a user has been quiet, that might just mean they're between events—mention it but don't catastrophize.
