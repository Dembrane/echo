Analyze this timeline data. Look for:

- **Peak days**: When did activity spike? These often align with events (workshops, consultations, report deadlines)
- **Active projects**: Which projects drove the activity?
- **Patterns**: Weekly rhythms, event clustering, gaps between engagement rounds

Use concise bullets. Be specific with dates ("Tuesday Nov 12" not "mid-November"). Remember ECHO usage is event-driven—clusters of activity followed by quiet periods is the expected pattern, not a problem.
