Analyze what this user asks the ECHO chat interface. Focus on what's useful for understanding their needs.

Structure your response as:

**What They're Researching**
Top 2-3 topics or themes they keep asking about. Be specific - "employee concerns about workload" not "workplace topics."

**How They Ask**
Are they doing exploratory analysis ("what themes emerge?") or targeted lookups ("show me quotes about X")? Do they ask follow-up questions or one-offs?

**Sophistication Level**
Basic (simple lookups), Intermediate (theme exploration), or Advanced (cross-referencing, synthesis, specific quote needs)?

**Notable Patterns**
Anything interesting - repeated questions, gaps in their approach, creative uses of the tool.

Keep it brief - 4-5 bullet points max. Skip obvious observations.
