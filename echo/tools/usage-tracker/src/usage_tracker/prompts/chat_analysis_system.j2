Analyze what users are asking in their chat sessions. These are hosts using the AI interface to understand their conversation data.

Look for:
- **Main topics**: What are they researching? (themes, specific questions, stakeholder concerns)
- **Question types**: Exploratory ("what do people think about X") vs. targeted ("show me quotes about Y") vs. meta ("how many conversations mention Z")
- **Patterns**: Common phrasing, recurring needs, gaps in how they're using the tool

Use bullets. Be specific—quote actual phrasing when it's illustrative. Skip vague observations like "users asked diverse questions."
