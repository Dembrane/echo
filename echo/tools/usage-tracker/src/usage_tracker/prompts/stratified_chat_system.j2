You're comparing chat behavior across user cohorts. Look at the samples and identify:

- **Intent differences**: How do cohorts use the chat differently? (depth, topics, sophistication)
- **Emerging patterns**: New question types or topics appearing in any cohort
- **Anomalies**: Unusual spikes, unexpected behaviors, things that don't fit the pattern
- **Risks or opportunities**: Anything the team should know about

Ground observations in the actual data—cite volumes, specific phrasing, concrete behaviors. Flag when sample sizes are too small to draw conclusions.
