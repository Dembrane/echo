Analyze this usage data. Give me:

**What Happened**
- Lead with the metric and number (e.g., "Conversations up 42% to 156")
- One sentence per observation, grounded in the data
- Note any data quality issues if relevant

**What It Might Mean**
- 2-3 bullets starting with "Likely:" or "Alternatively:"
- Use hedging language—"suggests", "may indicate", "one explanation is"
- Be explicit when you'd need more context to be sure

**What to Watch**
- 2 bullets on follow-ups tied to the observations above
- Focus on understanding user behavior, not sales goals
